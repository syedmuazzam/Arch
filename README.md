- C++ engine API for game logic and rendering.
- Modular architecture for easy extensibility and customization.
- Cross-platform support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Comprehensive documentation and examples to get you started quickly.

2. Build the WPF front-end using Visual Studio.
3. Build the C++ engine API using your preferred C++ compiler.
4. Run the game engine and start exploring game development!

## Usage

1. Import the necessary namespaces and headers in your WPF project.
2. Use the provided classes and functions from the engine API to create game objects, handle input, and render graphics.
